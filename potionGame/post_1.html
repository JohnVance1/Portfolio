        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          Welcome! You've stumbled upon the development blog for the game The Alchemist(working title).
          Here I'll be posting weekly updates on my progress as a way to both have a record 
          of my progress as well as keep myself motivated.
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody">
          This game is a solo project that I have been developing for around a month 
          now. I recently graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology and while I 
          worked on my Capstone, The Shattering Swords, with 10 others and a few Game Jams
          alone, this is the first game I have worked on solo with a large scope. The 
          project will culminate in a release however because of the early stage it is in 
          I don't have a release schedule yet.          
        </p>


        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Background</h4>
        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          Since this is my first post I'll start by explaining the game I'm working on. The game
          is a 2D isometric adventure game with the current working title, The Alchemist, created 
          in Unity. Within the game the player discovers and catalogs ingredients to make potions, 
          has a small greehouse where they can grow herbs, help out the villagers, and heal the 
          surrounding land through the potions they create. 
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody">
          You play as an alchemist that has been assigned to the town to cataloge the various 
          herbs and discover why the surrouding land is becoming corrupted. When you arrive the 
          town has been produced to ruins from the surrounding corruption and with your ability
          to harness the local wildlife you craft potions and research new ingredients to help
          clense the town. Further into the forest you find more herbs, stronger corruption, and 
          perhaps what is behind it. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Current Progress</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          My current progress has mainly been in the systems and overarching design of the game.
          In the last month I've worked on the design for the cauldron, growing herbs, and foreging.
          The core loop of the game will involve the player going out and gathering herbs, making 
          potions, helping the town/the land, and repeating. 
        </p>

            <img class="col-md-12 blogImage" style="max-width: 400px;" src="/Portfolio/images/AlcGame/AlcGame_Pickup.gif" alt="Pickup Example"/></img>
          </div>       
          <p>
            Currently the player is able to pick up herbs (the green objects) which are added to their inventory.
            I want the player to have easy access to their inventory to see both what potions
            and herbs they have. The overall functionallity is there however the look and feel
            will be updated later.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Also the player is able to use a farm plot (the orange space) to plant and grow herbs.
            The player selects the herb they want to plant from their inventory and then after some time 
            the plant reaches it's fully grown stage and the player can harvest it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blogBody">  
          <div class="row d-flex justify-content-around">
            <img class="col-md-12 blogImage" style="max-width: 400px;" src="/Portfolio/images/AlcGame/AlcGame_MakePotionSimple.gif" alt="Make Potion Example"/></img>
          </div>        
          <p>
            The player can also make a very simple potion using the one herb that they are able to collect.
            The player uses the interact button, currently bound to Mouse 0, and if they have the required
            herb, the potion is placed in their inventory and the herb is removed.
