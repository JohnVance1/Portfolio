        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          So it's been a while since my last post. In my last post I talked about shipping a smaller game where I could finish it in a few months. 
          I actually didn't end up doing that. Instead I worked on a small puzzle game that I somewhat released on itch.io a few weeks ago. It is based off 
          of the research mechanic in The Herbalist but instead of a square grid it is a grid of hexagons. Since then I've transitioned to working on The Herbalist 
          more and starting to flesh out the NPC and Quest systems. Overall, I've been very burnt-out lately from job searching and I haven't had my usual energy 
          to develop my own projects. I've been more motivated lately to work on The Herbalist partially because I'm attending the Midwest Game Developers Conference 
          this week and I want to have some progress done on the game since GDC earlier this year.

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">New Project</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          So what am I working on next? I took a few days to decide on the project I wanted to work on. I knew it needed to be simple but could also showcase 
          some of my technical skills. Primarily with developing an AI system that I could point to as experience in that realm. The game I ended up deciding 
          on was a thief puzzle game for mobile. I'm planning on having all of the assets be very simple and the overall game will be based on a 5x5 grid. 
          On each level there will be at least one Guard and some sort of treasure that the Player has to grab and get out with. Eventually each level will be 
          partially randomized but for now I'm going to hand make each level. 
          
          <br>

          Each Guard in the level will move after the Player moves so that the Player can choose where to move and then the Guards will react accordingly. The goal 
          of each puzzle is to grab and get out with the treasure without being spotted by a Guard. Eventually I am going to add in additional enemies like a Guard 
          Dog and possibly lasers but for now I'm going to stick to one Guard type and the Player.

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Add Guard AI System</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          For the next sprint I'm planning on adding in a GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Plan) System for the Guards to give them a little bit more of autonomy in their 
          decision making. I'm also planning on fully implementing the game logic for the Walls, Treasure, and Start Node I mentioned above. I think that I'll be 
          able to implement all of these within two weeks since I have implemented GOAP systems before so I'm not expecting many hiccups along the way. Also, I've been 
          a very bad programmer and I haven't done any pull requests. I've just been pushing and pulling from the same repository so I'll link the repo below 
          and make sure to include a pull request in the next post!
