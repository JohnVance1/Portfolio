        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          This will be a fairly small update since I was on vacation the past week and wasn't able to work on the game. 
          First and foremost I was able to mostly accomplish what I planned to do for the past sprint. I finished up the Quest 
          Log and make it visually update for the player. I also implemented all of the controller input 
          however I ran into one major issue that I will go over in a later section.

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Quest Journal UI</h4>


        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          The Quests are separated by Active and Completed with unobtained Quests not being shown. Eventually I want to 
          have the UI mimic the Quest Log in Baulder's Gate 3 where the Quest info is displayed on the right of the screen 
          but that can wait for another update. It is a fairly basic UI now but in terms of showing information to the 
          player it functions as is.

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Controller Input</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          All of the major controls are now implemented to use both Keyboard and Mouse and controller however 
          I was only partially able to implement being able to navigate a grid menu with the controller. Through 
          researching Unity's UI systems I found that the UI Builder I was using for all of my UI elements has a major 
          drawback that I hadn't seen when I initially decided to use it. It doesn't natively allow for the Navigate function to 
          work as effectively as the Canvas UI system. With the Canvas UI you can set up UI elements to Navigate to certain elements 
          when the directional buttons are pressed through the inspector. However, with the Ui Builder that functionality hasn't 
          been implemented yet. The only way to replicate it using the UI Builder is to program the navigation myself which I was 
          able to mostly complete but because of the learning curve, I wasn't able to finish it in time for the end of the sprint.

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Finish Controller Support and Work on Shrine System</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          For the next sprint I want to fully finish the controller support and then move on to working on the final system for 
          the MVP which is the Shrine System. The Shrine System is going to be the main way that the player progresses throughout 
          the game. The player will need to place a certain number of potions with certain effects to open new areas and assist in 
          healing the surrounding land.
