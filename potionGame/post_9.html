        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          I was able to do a decent amount this sprint and the majority of which was spent on 
          updating the game's UI. To start, I'm still in the process of switching over everything 
          from Canvas to Unity's UI Builder/Toolkit which I feel is a lot easier to use and iterate 
          on. I have mostly finished the base inventory and then I am going to start on the other UI 
          systems that I currently have implemented.  
 
             
        </p>        


        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Old UI to New</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          The current UI was a little clunky and while it worked, it was a little too complicated 
          programming wise for what it did. About halfway into the sprint I found the UI Builder 
          which I had never used before and I really like it compared to the original Canvas structure. 
          Below I've put some images as to the what the old and new UI look like and as with everything 
          style wise it is 1000% not final and is definitly going to change. The current style I have 
          for the UI is based off of a tutorial I did to learn the UI builder and while it doesn't 
          fit the aestetic I want, it's a good enough placeholder.

          The UI Builder is really nice as a lot of the styleing is done similarly to CSS in web 
          development. I have been doing web tutoring for a year or so now in my free time so it 
          makes a lot more sense to me than having to relearn a whole new system for Canvas. Also, 
          implementing the UI is A LOT easier with the fact that each UI element is a single GameObject 
          with the herarchy being in the UI Builder window. Another nice feature is that you can make 
          templates without having to create prefabs and you can just denote that a script is a visualelement 
          without creating an entire new GameObject for it. I know that this section is a bit long but the 
          last really helpful aspect is that because they aren't GameObjects in the world the ability to 
          do methods like OnPointerDown() and OnPointerMove() are extremely easy to implement. 

          <br><br>

          Overall, the UI Builder/Toolkit is extremely helpful and I am surprised I haven't used this feature sooner.

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">New UI Features</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          While I mainly worked on shifting everything over, I did have some time to implement a new 
          feature for the Inventory which is a click and drag to organize and adjust items to how a player 
          wants. There are some bugs to work out however I think that it will allow for players to better find 
          their items and I am hoping to get the final bugs fixed in the next sprint. 
        </p> 

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          I also worked to fix the funtionallity on the Masyu game and hooked it up to the MVP loop so now 
          players have to research the herb before being able to use it in the cauldron. Additionally, they 
          can't research an herb more than once.

          <br><br>

          Eventually I want to let the player be able to use the herbs in potions whether they have researched it 
          or not and the player just won't know the effects that the herb gives but for simplicity sake I am just going 
          to prevent players from using them so they can playtest the researching mini-game. 
        </p> 

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Switch Over UI </h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          Most of the next two weeks are going to be focused on moving all of the UI from the current Canvas system 
          to the UI Toolkit system. If I have some extra time I want to have the herbs that are in the cauldron show up 
          on the side to indicate what has been used so far. I am assuming now that I know the UI Toolkit better I will 
          get to achomplish that this sprint but we will see how busy I end up being this week!
