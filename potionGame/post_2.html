        </h2>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          So first off I decided to post these every two weeks instead of every week. I found that 
          I was only halfway through the next feature when it was time to post a new update and 
          decided it would be better to have a full feature shown off rather than half of one. 
        </p>        


        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Researching Herbs</h4>
        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          Speaking of the feature, the main feature that I designed and prototyped this week was the 
          researching mini-game that the player interacts with everytime they discover a new herb. 
          Contained within the player's house is a research station that the player uses to discover 
          each herb's properties. Here they learn various things about the herb such as elemental properties
          and the ideal preperation method. 
        </p>

        <div class="blogBody">
          <p>
            For the actual gameplay for this feature I struggled for a while trying to figure out what 
            would be the best way to convey a "research" game. I knew that it had to have a few components:
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanics must be relatively simple to understand since it's a section 
                of the gameplay not all of it.</li>
              <li>Must be scaleable to be harder for rarer herbs.</li>
              <li>Needs to be a puzzle so players feel like they are researching.</li>
            </ul>
            After researching and looking at other games for inspiration I finally came across a logic puzzle 
            that I could refactor to fit all of my criteria: Masyu.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          For those unfamiliar, Masyu is a logic puzzle laid out on a grid with white and black dots ocupying 
          a select few grid spaces. The goal is to connect all of the dots in a loop while obeying each colored dots'
          rules. For black dots, you need to turn as the line passes through it and for white dots you need to
          go straight through. Additionally, the spaces before and after the black dots have to be straight while 
          for the white dots they need to turn. 
        </p>

              <p style="text-align: center;">Base Game</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">(Green == Start, Red == End)</p>

            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <img class="blogImage" style="max-width: 400px;" src="/Portfolio/images/AlcGame/ResearchGameCompleted.PNG" alt="Pickup Example"/></img>
              </div>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Completed Game</p>

            </div>
          </div>       
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          I decided to change around the game slightly and remove the requirement for the before and after lines
          as well as the requirement for a loop. Each mini-game will differ based on the herb and will be hand crafted
          to said herb. Instead of a loop there will be a set amount of end points The difficulty of each puzzle 
          will involve the placement/number of dots as well as the number of end points. The white and black dots are 
          replaced with elemental runes corresponding to the elements contained in the herb. The player will need to 
          connect all of the runes in one or more lines with the end of each line connecting to an end point. 
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          This system would allow for the player to come up with their own solutions to each game as well as scale complexity
          as needed. While currently the mechanic is mainly functional, I am really happy with the puzzle mechanic as I feel like games
          similar to mine struggle to make progression harder within the later stages of the game. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Using the Cauldron and Making Postions</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          In addition, I worked on a bit on the cauldron component of potion making. I implemented three seperate devices that
          the player can use to increase or decrease certain attributes. These devices are a distiller, a mortar and pestle, 
          and a smoker. Each herb can also be included into the cauldron as a raw ingredient to use it's base attributes. 
          Currently I haven't implemented the herb attribute system so it only outputs the same potion no matter what. 
        </p>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            (Red = Distiller,  Orange = Mortar and Pestle,  Blue = Smoker,  Green = Make Potion,  Purple = Cancel,  Black = Cauldron)

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Art</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          For the next sprint I'm planning on figuring out more of the artstyle and attempting to create some of
          the assets. While I am not particuarly good at art, I have done some pixel art, like the character 
          currently in the game, however I'm still not sure if I want to do a pixel art style for the game.
