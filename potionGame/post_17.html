        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          So it's been a little while since I posted one of these but over the last month I've done a lot of redesigning of the game 
          and put a lot of thought into what I want the initial MVP of the game to end up as. This just so happens to coincide with the 
          fact that I'm planning on attending GDC this year and I want to have a playable prototype by then that I can show off. 
          More recently I've been debating about what to put into the final build for GDC.
              
        </p>        

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">MVP Direction</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          Initially I wanted the MVP to be ready with all of the systems in play and having a very vertical slice of everything. However 
          after discussing the my goals with a few of my friends and given that GDC is only about a month away I am deciding to pivot 
          and focus solely on the crafting and research aspects of the potions for my initial build. I think that this shift is much more reasonable 
          and will allow me to focus on some of the core systems and what makes my game unique.

   
        </p>

        <div class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          <p>          
            My current plans for GDC build are:             
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expand and flesh out the Player's house</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This includes designing where important objects, like the cauldron and research station, go and decorations if possible</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Include very basic farm plots where the player can harvest 1 herb of each type (likely infinitely)  </li>
            <li>Add in UI for the herbs added into the cauldron displaying how much of each element is currently in the cauldron</li>
            <li>Add in two more herbs to have 1 herb for each element</li>
            <li>Add in a research mini-game for each of the 6 herbs   </li>
            <li>Create and add in assets for the Herb Journal</li>
            <li>Create a UI for the player to keep track of Potions made</li>
            <li>Add in an instructional/tutorial for the research mini-game as well as the rest of the game</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            While this is a decently large list I am pretty confident in my ability to finish it all.
          </p>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Changes Since Last Post</h4>


        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          So while a lot of the last five weeks has been design focused I have gotten a decent amount of work done on the development side of the game. The first major update is that I ended up completely switching the UI from the UI Toolkit back 
          to the Canvas system. I feel like because the limitations and extra steps I needed to take in order to get the same functionality
          that is native to the Canvas system I became increasingly focused on the UI and it ended up taking a lot of development time. 
          Now after switching over to the Canvas system I am hoping for it to be a more streamlined process when it comes to developing 
          more UI elements.
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">          
          Speaking of which I have developed a lot of assets for the UI including actual inventory assets, research mini-game assets, and environmental 
          props however these environmental assets won't be used in the GDC build. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Work on Polishing Mechanics and Kepp up with Blog Posts</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          I'm planning on working on getting a couple features in the next two weeks such as a UI element for displaying the current herb 
          elements that the player has put into the Cauldron and a system for holding potions that the player has made and what elements 
          went into it. Also I want to be more consistent with my blog posts since most of these are supposed to be two weeks long.
