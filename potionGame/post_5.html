        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          I'll start off by saying that I was a little in over my head when I said that I wanted to finish the MVP 
          this sprint. When I finally got down to detailing out everything I realized that there were more than 
          just a few things I needed to accomplish. That being said, I did manage to get up some semblance of an 
          MVP.
        </p>        


        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">MVP</h4>
        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          The bare bones of the MVP is finished. The Player can go into the town and talk to the NPC to receive a 
          quest. That quest leads the player to get the two herbs outside and upon returning to the Player's house, 
          they can use those herbs to make the potion the NPC wants. 
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">      
          While the MVP itself is done, the underlying code is already a mess and the overall MVP is functional at best. 
          I'm really not satisfied with the current state of the MVP and I really hope to improve it into something 
          I can be more proud of over the next few sprints. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">The State of the Game</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          Recently I've been pretty burnt out on this project despite how much I want to work on it. I think 
          most of the reason I'm burnt out is because of how dissatisfied I am with the overall game. Most of the code 
          is a mess and I keep changing the architecture as I go along and there is a lot of scripts that 
          I've either deprecated or have lines upon lines of unused code. Additionally, while art is not my strong suit at 
          all, it is something that I really want to catch potential player's attentions and though I'm not expecting 
          any art I make or use to be final, I really want something that looks halfway decent.
  
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          Overall, I do really enjoy working on this game however recently I think there are a few things I wish I went 
          back and fleshed out what I'm planning on doing in the next few sprints. My main focus from now on will be to 
          flesh out the design/code structure on paper first before just diving into the code and trying to get something 
          to work.   
        </p>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Code Architecture</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          While I can't master my art skills in two weeks I can do something I'm good at which is designing the code 
          architecture. While it may not seem like it from this current project I have designing code architecture 
          for most of the team projects I've worked on both during my Master's/Bachelor's and while working in the 
          industry. For some reason I just want to code when I have an idea in my head instead of trying to figure 
          out how the code should look. Even though I 100% should have done this from the beginning, I'm going to 
          take a step back from the code itself and take a broader look at how the code should be structured. I'm 
          also going to make sure I do more research into Unity's engine to see if I need to refactor my code around 
          any limitations I might run into.
