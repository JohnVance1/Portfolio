        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Intro</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          After looking at the code for the last two weeks I think I've gotten it to the state where I'm going to 
          start developing again. From looking at all of the scripts I've made I have some better ideas on how 
          to structure the classes to have each script make a little more sense. I first started by just detailing all 
          of the scripts and what was contained in them and then went and modified them to be more concise.  
        </p>        


        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">UML Class Diagram</h4>

        <div class="blogBody">    
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
            <img class="blogImage" style="max-width: 800px;" src="/Portfolio/images/AlcGame/AlcGame_ClassDiagram.PNG" alt="NPC Movement"/></img>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Main Changes</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          The above image shows the current class diagram that I came up with. One of the main differences is the 
          Player class which has been split up into a few different scripts. The current Player class has a lot 
          of lines and is kind of bloated. A goal of mine for the next sprint is to update the Player class to 
          reflect these changes and have each script running one action like movement, interaction, and UI.  
        </p>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          I also realized that the connection between the interactable objects and their UI can be streamlined. 
          Particularly the Cauldron_UI script where the devices could definitely be reworked to be less complex. 
          My plan is to separate the UI and objects so that the UI elements are just UI elements and aren't 
          storing values that the objects themselves should be storing. This includes the Cauldron, Research Station, 
          Devices, and Inventory.    
  
        </p>        

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          The one section of the code that I have yet to flesh out is the quest system. It will definitely need a large 
          overhaul and is something that I am going to put on the backburner for now. The currently implemented quest 
          system isn't close to the final one and was mainly just a patch to get in the quest for the previous sprint. 
          I want to get the architecture changes implemented and functional, as well as getting the game to look somewhat 
          decent, before moving onto any new systems.
        </p>        

        

        <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Next Sprint: Resturcturing Code</h4>

        <p class="blogBody" style="margin: 10px 50px 50px 50px;">
          The next sprint I want to focus on implementing the changes I've made in the class diagram. specifically cleaning 
          up the connection between the interactable objects and their UI as well as separating the Player class. As I go 
          along I will probably end up adding and editing the current class diagram and I want to make sure that it is fully 
          updated before I continue to work on anything else. I'm also going to make sure that any features I work on next 
          will have their own class diagram as well as user stories to help me along the development pipeline. If I have any 
          time near the end of the sprint I'm planning on searching for some temp assets as the ones I currently have I'm still 
          not satisfied with.
